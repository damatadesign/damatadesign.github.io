      <p>Using my family's vintage photos, Life's Postcards is a personal project where I created distinct and personal collages as postcards. Postcards are a method of communication in order for people to commemorate a physical place they've traveled to. Using that same concept, I wanted to cherish the important moments in a person's lifetime as different places in time. </p>
      <p>The softwares used were Illustrator and Photoshop. However, a lot of the work was done using paper objects around my house and combining them to make an interesting collage. </p>
      <p>The biggest challenge was to find the correct imagery for the concept of my project.  </p>
