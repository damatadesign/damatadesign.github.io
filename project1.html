    <article class="text-project1 bounce-in-top">
      <p>I created a fictional magazine called Hidden Creatures that focuses on cryptozoology, a pseudoscience aiming to prove the existence of folkloric creatures, also known as cryptids. Inspired by magazines like the Weekly World News, Hidden
        Creatures is based purely on people's sightings across the world. They aim to share with its readers the odd, mysterious and inexplicable things of our world in order to incite curiosity and excitement. </p>
      <p>The softwares used were Illustrator, Indesign and Photoshop</p>
      <p>The challenges for this project were creating the imagery of the magazine. Since many of the sightings date back decades ago, the photographs were limited and so I had to work with a small selection of images. </p>
