      <p>The mandate for this project was to create a promotional poster and milk carton for a milk campaign that presented the product as a natural source of comfort for people. I wanted to represent the comfort of milk as a warm cozy blanket. Mimicking its checkered look and polygonal shapes, I created a pattern in the style of a quilted blanket with milk-related illustrations. Furthermore, I was also inspired by the milky way and decided to make my promotional poster cosmos-themed, with the slogan "Taste the heavens". </p>
      <p>The softwares used were Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
      <p>The challenges for this project was trying to come up with an original concept for this project. I wanted to challenge myself by staying away from the typical imagery that we see in milk campaigns.   </p>
