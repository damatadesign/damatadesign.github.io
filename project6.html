      <p>The mandate for this project was to create a promotional poster for a milk campaign that presented the product as a natural source of comfort for people. I wanted to represent the comfort of milk as a warm cozy blanket. Mimicking its checkered look and polygonal shapes, I created a pattern in the style of a quilted blanket with milk-related illustrations. Furthermore, I was also inspired by the milky way and decided to make my promotional poster cosmos-themed, with the slogan "Taste the heavens". </p>
      <p>The softwares used were Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
      <p>The challenges for this project were creating the imagery of the magazine. Since many of the sightings date back decades ago, the photographs were limited and so I had to work with a small selection of images. </p>
