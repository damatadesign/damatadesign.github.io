        <p>This was a personal project where I designed a poster inspired by the Montreal-based music collective called "Godspeed You Black Emperor!".Using some of their original illustrations, I designed a poster using photos I took of churches from all over Montreal. Also, I created a video centred around their song "Storm" using the visuals of the poster.  </p>
        <p>The softwares used were Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
        <p>The challenges for this project were creating the imagery of the magazine. Since many of the sightings date back decades ago, the photographs were limited and so I had to work with a small selection of images. </p>
