      <p>As the final project of our first session, we were asked to produce a booklet for a fictional exhibition on graphic design at the McCord Museum. I decided to focus my booklet on the mental health aspect of being a graphic designer. Inspired by the book The Poetry Remedy: Prescriptions for the Heart, Mind, and Soul by William Sieghart, I shared a variety of different poems and associated them to the mental states that a designer can go through. This project is printed as a 12-page accordion booklet with illustrations flowing across.
      <p>The softwares used were Illustrator and Indesign</p>
      <p>The challenge for this project was creating the physical mockup. Since I wanted the illustrations to flow naturally across the whole pamphlet, I decided to challenge myself with a twelve-page accordion pamphlet. This required separating the pamphlet into thirds and aligning manually each section, while taking into account the illustrations on the backside. </p>
